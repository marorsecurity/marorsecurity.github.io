Thank you for attending my talk, "Executing your unemployment incident response
plan." Slides will be posted eventually. Here are some resources I mentioned.

[Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute](https://a.co/d/iDik4LY) on
Amazon. This isn't an affiliate link. I'm not above affiliate links, I'm just
too lazy or busy to get one set up right now.

[Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts) has podcasts on
career management topics including interviewing, résumé creation, unemployment, and
keeping a job. 

[NIST 800-61](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/ipd) is not designed
to help you get a new job, but who knows?

[Outkast - The Videos](https://a.co/d/9THOPVM) because I used visuals from
"Hey Ya!" BUT ALSO BECAUSE it's great to see this duo develop as musicians.
Yes, I own a copy of this DVD. 

[Scholarships to the Waking Up App](https://app.wakingup.com/scholarship) are
available for folks who could benefit from mindfulness meditation, but whose
financial circumstances preclude paying for a membership. If this app
benefits you during your period of unemployment, consider becoming a member
when you start getting a paycheck.

Thanks again!
